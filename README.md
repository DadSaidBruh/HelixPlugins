# HelixPlugins
A bunch of simple plugins for Helix created by me.
The plugins were originally created for my server "CompleteRP".

## QTE Survival
When a player's health drops to 0, they can quickly press the button to save them from death once.
When your health drops to zero, a shaking text appears on the screen (the text itself is easily customizable).

## ChatPlus
A very simple plugin that adds global rp chat (/grp) and advertising chat (/adverts).

## Garbage cleaner
The plugin adds the /ClearJunk command which removes from the floor all items whose names are listed in the "trash" list.
